# Executive summary

## Background & Aim

MINGAR is a fitness monitoring wearable device manufacturer. As the
wearables market grows, the company has introduced a new line of
lower-cost products called 'Active' and 'Advance' to compete with other
companies in the space, such as Bitfit. The goal of this study is to
determine the user demography of MINGAR's new goods in order to assess
the company's current market position, as well as to see if any of its
products have performance concerns connected to sleep monitoring for
users of certain skin colors.

## Key Findings

-   Customers who live in lower-income areas and are slightly older in
    age than customers of MINGAR's other lines have been drawn to the
    new affordable product lines "Active" and "Advance."

-   The likelihood of a consumer purchasing a gadget from MINGAR's
    inexpensive line over a device from MINGAR's other lines reduces by
    around 96 percent for every
    `r toString(signif(1 / (max(cust_dev_info$income) - min(cust_dev_info$income)), 3))`
    Canadian dollar increase in that customer's median region income
    (see Figure 2).(see Figure 2).

-   The likelihood of a customer selecting a device from MINGAR's cheap
    line over a device from MINGAR's other lines improves by around 46%
    for every
    `r toString(signif(1 / (max(cust_dev_info$age) - min(cust_dev_info$age)), 2))`
    years of customer age (see Figure 1)

-   Customers who use darker skin tone emoji modifiers have a higher
    maximum number of flags per sleep session than those who use lighter
    or default skin tone emoji modifiers (see Figure 3).

-   Users with default, light, medium-light, and medium skin tones saw a
    24.55 percent increase in the number of flags every additional
    minute of sleep, compared to users with medium-dark and dark skin
    tones.

## Limitations

-   The Naftali team didn't have direct access to client data like
    income. Instead, consumer income was calculated based on the area's
    median income via postal code.

-   Because emoji skin tone isn't an exact indicator of a user's race or
    ethnicity, conclusions about the relationship between device
    performance and skin tone are questionable.

# Technical report

## Introduction

With the purpose of providing insights for better product thinking, this
report delivers consumer and product data on MINGAR's fitness monitoring
wearable devices. To gain a deeper understanding of the client market
for MINGAR's two cheap lines ('Active' and 'Advance,' the Naftali team
examines the demographic features of new customers drawn so far by these
products, with a special focus on the intended lower-income customer
segment. This paper also analyzes the disparity in product performance
for customers of various races, as well as the underlying concerns that
this creates. The investigation was undertaken with ethical
considerations in mind, and the report includes a description of
Naftali's ethical code of conduct.

### Research questions

-   What are the demographic differences between customers of the new
    low-cost product lines ("Active" and "Advance") and users of prior
    fitness wearable lines? The goal of this question is to see if the
    low-cost product lines were successful in attracting new clients
    from the lower-income target market.

-   Are there any unusual differences in the quality of the data
    collected by MINGAR fitness wearables for customers of different
    races (particularly those with darker skin tones) and sleep
    patterns?

## Customers of MINGAR's New Afforable Lines

We used the cancensus API to get 2016 median incomes for each census
subdivision specified by its unique CSDuid - the Canadian census
subdivision ID - for research question 1. Then, via the University of
Toronto webpage, we downloaded 2016 Census Canada Postal Code Conversion
Files, which show the CSDuid for various postcodes. We were able to
compute median income for each postal code by combining these datasets.
Then, to estimate our customers' incomes, we combined this newly
connected dataset with our customer data by postcode. It's worth noting
that some consumers have multiple postcodes (and hence, are matched with
more than 1 income). We assigned the mean of the many incomes to such
customers.In addition, we introduced a new variable called "age" to our
customer data to indicate the customer's current age. On customer ID, we
then integrated this customer information data with customer-device
matchup data. We were able to obtain information on clients as well as
the unique ID of their device as a result of this, the information on
each customer's device was then retrieved by merging this dataset with
our device dataset on theÂ device ID. After that, we chose the relevant
factors so that our report did not reveal our customer's sensitive
information.

We generated a new binary variable in the dataset as a last data
cleaning step that takes the value 1 if a customer is considered "new"
(i.e., a purchase of our line of "Active" or "Advance" items) and 0
otherwise. This enabled us to create a model that predicts whether a
customer belongs to the camp of "new" customers or the camp of
"traditional" customers based on some information about the customer,
which helped us answer the question of who our new customers are and how
they differ from those we consider to be our more "traditional"
customers.

To begin, we performed some exploratory data analysis on the
distribution of regional median earnings among the consumers from whom
we received information:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Box plots displaying incomes of customers who purchased MINGAR's new affordable line (i.e. 'New Customers') vs. customers who purchased MINGAR's other lines (i.e. 'Traditional Customers')."}
# Create boxplots to depict the distribution of customer median incomes.
# in both the new and traditional groups
cust_dev_info %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = income)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~is_new, 
             nrow = 2,
             labeller = labeller(is_new = c("1" = "New Customers", "0" = "Traditional Customers"))) +
  ggtitle("The Distribution of Median Income of the Sampled Customers") +
  xlab("Median Income (in Canadian dollars)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can observe from the above boxplots that the distribution of median
salaries for both traditional and new customers appears to be skewed to
the right, with a lot of outliers in the right tail, which is to be
expected given that income distributions bias to the right in most
circumstances. Another similarity between the two categories of
consumers is that, as seen by the positioning of the middle bars in the
box, the median of the median income for both groups is roughly the
same. However, one noteworthy contrast between the two categories of
consumers is that the interquartile range of the median income for new
customers appears to be shorter than that of the established customers.
The lower interquartile range shows that, while the two sets of
consumers have identical median incomes, the new customers may have
slightly less fluctuation in median income. As a result, the variable of
median income may play a role in distinguishing clients from the new and
conventional groups.

Then we looked at the age distribution of these customers:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Box plots displaying ages of customers who purchased MINGAR's new affordable line (i.e. 'New Customers') vs. customers who purchased MINGAR's other lines (i.e. 'Traditional Customers')."}
# Draw boxplots describing the distribution of ages for customers
# in both the new and traditional groups
cust_dev_info %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~is_new, 
             nrow = 2,
             labeller = labeller(is_new = c("1" = "New Customers", "0" = "Traditional Customers"))) +
  ggtitle("The Distribution of Age of the Sampled Customers") +
  xlab("Age (in years)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can observe from the above boxplots that the distribution of ages is
roughly skewed to the right for both traditional and new clients.
Furthermore, as evidenced by the positioning of the middle bars in the
boxes, the median and spread of ages for both groups are roughly the
same. The only significant difference between the two distributions is
that ages considered outliers for traditional customers are not
considered outliers for new customers, implying that the frequency of
ages for traditional customers gradually decreases as they get older,
whereas the frequency of older ages for new customers abruptly
decreases.This means that most characteristics of the two distributions,
such as median and skew, are similar, and we should be cautious about
using age to forecast whether a consumer belongs to the conventional or
new group.

Finally, we looked at the frequency of the following pronouns among
these customers:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Bar plots displaying pronouns of customers who purchased MINGAR's new affordable line (i.e. 'New Customers') vs. customers who purchased MINGAR's other lines (i.e. 'Traditional Customers')."}
# Draw bar plots describing the frequencies of pronouns used by customers
# in both the new and traditional groups
cust_dev_info %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pronouns)) +
  geom_bar(fill="#FAAA8D") +
  facet_wrap(~is_new,
             nrow = 1,
             labeller = labeller(is_new = c("1" = "New Customers", "0" = "Traditional Customers"))) +
  ggtitle("The Frequencies of Different Pronouns Among the Sampled Customers") +
  xlab("Pronouns") +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can see from the above bar plots that "she/her" is the most regularly
used pronoun for both traditional and new clients, followed by "he/him"
and "they/them." We can also see that the bars in the plot corresponding
to the new customers are taller than those in the other plot, which is
to be expected given that the conventional camp has 8476 customers and
the new camp has 10569. Given how comparable the frequencies of pronouns
are across both groups, we must be cautious when selecting whether to
utilize pronouns as a predictor for detecting whether a consumer belongs
to the conventional or new group.

Before we start building preliminary models, remember that we're trying
to figure out who buys our "Active" and "Advance" line products and how
they differ from our traditional customers who buy other lines. We know
that the color of the emoji customers use has no direct or quantifiable
(but still significant) impact on whether they belong to the new or
traditional camp, so we'll include it as a random effect.

Now that we have the tools, we can start working on our basic models. We
must use a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) for this data because
the response is binary and we have a random effect. To begin, we create
a GLMM with all of the potential predictors we have thus far, such as
pronouns, median income, and age. After that, we design an auxiliary
model that excludes pronouns as a predictor and another that excludes
age as a predictor, because we couldn't tell whether they would be good
predictors just by looking at the boxplots in the prior exploratory data
analysis.

It's worth noting that the GLMM models' assumptions are met:

-   Our subjects are independent as they are individual customers.

-   Random effects are normally distributed.

-   All features have constant variance.

```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# Build models for likelihood ratio tests
full_mod <- lme4::glmer(is_new ~ pronouns + scales::rescale(age) + scales::rescale(income) + (1 | emoji_modifier), data = cust_dev_info, family = 'binomial')
no_age <- lme4::glmer(is_new ~ pronouns + scales::rescale(income) + (1 | emoji_modifier), data = cust_dev_info, family = 'binomial')
no_pronouns <- lme4::glmer(is_new ~ scales::rescale(income) + scales::rescale(age) + (1 | emoji_modifier), data = cust_dev_info, family = 'binomial')

# Conduct likelihood ratio tests
lmtest::lrtest(no_age, full_mod)
lmtest::lrtest(no_pronouns, full_mod)
```

By running likelihood ratio tests between the model containing all the
predictors so far and the two auxiliary models, we conclude that while a
model without age as a predictor will NOT explain the data as well as
the model containing all the predictors (due to the LRT p-value of
6.426e-09), a model without pronouns as a predictor WILL explain the
data as well as the model containing all the predictors (due to the LRT
p-value of 0.1258). Thus, we conclude that pronouns can be discarded as
a predictor in our final model.

```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# Build the final model
finalmod <- lme4::glmer(is_new ~ scales::rescale(age) + scales::rescale(income) + (1 | emoji_modifier), data = cust_dev_info, family = 'binomial')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE, include = FALSE}
# Extract estimates and confidence intervals from final model
ests <- format(round(exp(summary(finalmod)$coeff)[,1], 2), nsmall = 2)
confint <- confint(finalmod)
cis <- format(round(exp(confint),2)[-1,], nsmall = 2)
cis_pretty <- str_c("(", trimws(cis[,1]), ", ", cis[,2], ")")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Build and output a table describing the estimates and 
# confidence intervals from the final model
my_pretty_table <- cbind(ests, cis_pretty)
rownames_for_table <- c("Baseline Odds", "Rescaled Age", "Rescaled Median Income")
colnames_for_table <- c("Estimate", "95% CI")
rownames(my_pretty_table) <- rownames_for_table
colnames(my_pretty_table) <- colnames_for_table

my_pretty_table %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Estimates of Odds Ratios and Corresponding 95 Percent Confidence Intervals")

```

To interpret the final model whose estimates and corresponding
confidence intervals are in Table 1, first note that we were forced to
rescale age and median income in order to allow R to properly build the
model. These variables were rescaled with the following formulae:

$$\text{age}_{\text{rescaled}} = \frac{\text{age}_\text{raw} - \min(\text{age})}{\max(\text{age}) - \min(\text{age})}$$

$$\text{income}_{\text{rescaled}} = \frac{\text{income}_\text{raw} - \min(\text{income})}{\max(\text{income}) - \min(\text{income})}$$

where $\text{age}_\text{raw}$ and $\text{income}_\text{raw}$ correspond
to the original, "raw" age (in years) or median income (in Canadian
dollars) value that is to be rescaled,
$\min(\text{age}), \min(\text{income}), \max(\text{age}),$ and
$\max(\text{income})$ correspond to the minimum and maximum age (in
years) and median income (in Canadian dollars) values among all
customers in the dataset, and $\text{age}_{\text{rescaled}}$ and
$\text{income}_{\text{rescaled}}$ correspond to the resulting rescaled
age and median income values.

In Table 1, we can first see that the estimate of the baseline odds
ratio is 1.93, which means that when both rescaled age and rescaled
median income are 0, the odds of a customer belonging to the new camp is
1.93 to 1. Since a rescaled age of 0 and a rescaled median income of 0
correspond to the age of `r toString(signif(min(cust_dev_info$age), 2))`
years and the median income of `r toString(min(cust_dev_info$income))`
Canadian dollars respectively, we can say that the odds ratio of a
customer belonging to the new camp is 1.93 to 1 when that customer is
`r toString(signif(min(cust_dev_info$age), 2))` years old and lives in a
region where the median income is
`r toString(min(cust_dev_info$income))` Canadian dollars.

In the next row of Table 1, we have that the estimate of the odds ratio
corresponding to the rescaled age is 1.46. This means that for every
unit increase in rescaled age, the odds of a customer belonging to the
new camp increase by about 46%. By definition, we have that a unit
increase in rescaled age corresponds to a
$\frac{1}{\max(\text{age}) - \min(\text{age})}$ increase in raw,
unscaled age (in years), so we conclude that for every approximately
`r toString(signif(1 / (max(cust_dev_info$age) - min(cust_dev_info$age)), 2))`
year increase in a customer's age (this is approximately
`r toString(signif(365 / (max(cust_dev_info$age) - min(cust_dev_info$age)), 2))`
days), the odds of that customer belonging to the new camp increases by
about 46%.

In the last row of Table 1, we have that the estimate of the odds ratio
corresponding to the rescaled median income is 0.04, which means that
for every unit increase in rescaled median income, the odds of a
customer belonging to the new camp decreases by about 96%. Using the
same logic as previously, we have that a unit increase in rescaled
median income corresponds to a
$\frac{1}{\max(\text{income}) - \min(\text{income})}$ increase in raw,
unscaled median income (in Canadian dollars), so we conclude that for
every approximately
`r toString(signif(1 / (max(cust_dev_info$income) - min(cust_dev_info$income)), 3))`
Canadian dollar increase in the median income of the region where a
customer resides, the odds of that customer belonging to the new camp
decreases by about 96%.

These estimates of the odds ratios corresponding to each of the
variables in the model tell us that the youngest and lowest income
customers have almost 2 to 1 odds of buying our newer and more
affordable Active and Advance line products, and this trend is made even
more clear by the fact that by even the smallest of increases in median
income, the odds of a customer purchasing a product from one of these
lines goes down by a staggering 96%. This allows us to conclude that
among our lower income customers, our Active and Advance line products
have indeed been able to attract considerable attention, and that our
new customers mainly reside in regions of lower median income.

## Device Performance for Customers of Different Races

To answer research question 2, we first gathered device information from
the Fitness Tracker info
hub[(link)](https://fitnesstrackerinfohub.netlify.app/), which included
the device's name, line, retail price, and features. After confirming
that we had authorization from the website to do so, we scraped all of
the data. We also included a few potentially useful variables in this
dataset, such as the retail price category of the item and its age based
on its release date. We merged the two datasets using the
client-provided data on the device to derive the device information
corresponding to each device ID. Because sleep score is our major
variable of interest, we only selected devices that can track sleep from
this list. We then combine this dataset with each customer's sleep data
to match each sleep session to the appropriate device. To preserve
client privacy, we only picked variables related to the investigation.
We also eliminated sessions with missing data for sex, pronouns, and/or
postcode because there weren't enough of them to constitute a meaningful
trend, and they aren't the predictors we want to focus on for this
subject. The UnicodeÂ for emoji modifiers were also changed to more
understandable labels.

With the data we had, the only way to determine the data's quality for a
specific sleep session was to count how many flags were raised
throughout that session. We were also compelled to employ a dummy
variable--using emoji-modifiers to estimate each customer's skin
tone--because we do not directly collect data on race or ethnicity. The
distribution of sleep session time is depicted in the following graph,
with varying numbers of flags raised for users using different emoji
modifiers. From the figure, note that we can see that when we are given
the emoji-modifier of a customer, the relationship between the duration
of sleep and the number of flags raised is roughly linear and
homoscedastic, so we decided to fit a linear mixed model. The reason why
we avoided generalized additive models is because we seeked to maximize
interpretability, as we needed to explain our model to our employers.

```{r performance_interaction_or_not, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Model with interaction included
device_performance_model_1 <- lm(flags ~ duration*emoji_modifier, 
                                 data=cust_sleep_complete)
# Model without included
device_performance_model_2 <- lm(flags ~ duration + emoji_modifier,
                                 data=cust_sleep_complete)

lmtest::lrtest(device_performance_model_1, device_performance_model_2)
# Interaction is needed
```

```{r age-or-sex, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Model with Sex included
device_performance_model_1 <- lmer(flags ~ duration*emoji_modifier + (1|sex), 
                                 data=cust_sleep_complete)
# Model with Age included
device_performance_model_2 <- lmer(flags ~ duration*emoji_modifier + 
                                     (1|age), data=cust_sleep_complete)
# Model with both Age and Sex included
device_performance_model_3 <- lmer(flags ~ duration*emoji_modifier + (1|sex) + 
                                     (1|age), data=cust_sleep_complete)

lmtest::lrtest(device_performance_model_1, device_performance_model_3)
# Evidence that Age is not needed

lmtest::lrtest(device_performance_model_2, device_performance_model_3)
# Evidence that we do not need sex
```

```{r bat_life-or-line, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Model with Sex included
device_performance_model_1 <- lmer(flags ~ duration*emoji_modifier + (1|line), 
                                 data=cust_sleep_complete)
# Model with Age included
device_performance_model_2 <- lmer(flags ~ duration*emoji_modifier + (1|bat_life), 
                                   data=cust_sleep_complete)
# Model with both Age and Sex included
device_performance_model_3 <- lmer(flags ~ duration*emoji_modifier + (1|line) + 
                                     (1|bat_life), data=cust_sleep_complete)

lmtest::lrtest(device_performance_model_1, device_performance_model_3)
# Evidence that bat_life is not needed

lmtest::lrtest(device_performance_model_2, device_performance_model_3)
# Evidence that line is not needed
```

As we are trying to understand if there are discrepancies between the
performance of the device (i.e., quality of the data measured) for
different sleep sessions, our predicted variable was the number of flags
raised for a given sleep session. We were primarily interested in how
the skin tone and the sleep quality affected these measurements, so we
set the emoji-modifiers and the duration of a sleep session as the fixed
effects. An ANOVA test led us to include the interaction between these
two variables in our model. This was our baseline model. After
performing many likelihood ratio tests on models with and without
various random effects (i.e., the customer's age and gender, as well as
the line and battery life of the device), we decided to include another
model with age as a random effect.

```{r performance_boxplot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Box-plots that show the distribution of the sleep quality for different number of flags and different emojis used.", fig.height=6.6}
# create a visualization

There were some very interesting findings from our final models, as well
as from our boxplot. First, from the boxplot, we can clearly see that
only customers that use the dark skin tone emoji-modifier have
experienced a sleep session with more than 22 flags. Similarly, only
customers with dark skin tone or medium-dark skin tone emoji-modifiers
have experienced a sleep session with more than 13 flags.

On to our models. The most meaningful thing to look at are the slopes of
the models, which are shown in the table below. The LM model is the
linear model with duration and the emoji-modifier (and its interaction)
while the LMM model is the linear mixed-model with age as another random
effect.

```{r summary_performance_model, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
summary(device_performance_model_fixed) # Summary of the fixed model
summary(device_performance_model_mixed) # Summary of the mixed model (with age)
```

```{r performance_table, echo=FALSE}
tibble(`Emoji Modifiers` = # The labels for the coefficients
         c("Default", 
           "Light Skin Tone", 
           "Medium-Light Skin Tone",
           "Medium Skin Tone", 
           "Medium-Dark Skin Tone", 
           "Dark Skin Tone"),
       `LM Model Increase` = # The coefficients for the linear mixed model
         c(0.006494,
           0.003046,
           0.007467,
           0.011354,
           0.022366,
           0.035384),
       `LMM Model Increase` = # The coefficients for the linear mixed model
         c(0.006487,
           0.003052,
           0.007457,
           0.011361,
           0.022352,
           0.035391)) %>% # Piping everything into the table
  knitr::kable(caption = "Average Increase in number of Flags for 1 more minute of sleep")
```

We can see that moving from a lighter emoji skin tone modifier to a
darker emoji skin tone modifier increases the average number of flags
for 1 minute of sleep for both models, strongly suggesting that the
device performs worse when used by someone with darker skin. This
indicates that the MINGAR social media team is dealing with a legitimate
issue.

## Discussion

Using our first research question to examine the customer base of the
new affordable lines ("Active" and "Advance" products), we find that for
every
`r toString(signif(1 / (max(cust_dev_info$income) - min(cust_dev_info$income)), 3))`Canadian
dollars increase in a customer's median region income, the likelihood of
that customer purchasing a device from MINGAR's affordable line over a
device from MINGAR's other lines decreases by roughly 96 percent.
Furthermore, for every
`r toString(signif(1 / (max(cust_dev_info$age) - min(cust_dev_info$age)), 2))`
years that a customer's age increases, the likelihood of that customer
selecting a device from MINGAR's inexpensive line ('Active' or'Advance')
over a device from MINGAR's other lines increases by around 46%.
Customers under the age of
`r toString(signif(min(cust_dev_info$age), 2))` who live in a location
with a typical income of `r toString(min(cust_dev_info$income))`have a
1.93 chance of purchasing a product from MINGAR's inexpensive lines.

As a result, we may deduce that the new inexpensive lines have attracted
customers who live in lower-income areas and are slightly older in age
than MINGAR's other lines' customers. As a result, the low-cost lines
have been successful in attracting new customers from the lower-income
target market.

Then we looked at the association between emoji skin tone modifier and
sleep session time, as well as the amount of flags present during that
session, which could be caused by device error or poor data quality.
Customers who use dark skin tone modifiers can get up to 22 flags per
sleep session, but customers who use default or lighter skin tones get
up to 12 flags. With each extra minute of sleep, the number of flags for
individuals with dark skin tone emoji modifiers grows by 0.035. Those
with light skin tones, on the other hand, only notice a 0.0030 rise in
the number of flags for each additional minute of sleep.

These findings imply that there is a link between the skin tone of emoji
modifiers and the quality of sleep data obtained by MINGAR's devices,
notably that customers with darker skin tone emoji modifiers have more
problems collecting data for longer sleep sessions.

### Strengths and limitations

The interpretability of our models is something that the Naftali team
takes pleasure in. The team makes a special effort to work with
human-understandable models whenever possible. In fact, all of the final
models in this paper are simple to understand. Understanding the
decisions that an algorithm makes is crucial because it might assist
identify inherent prejudice in the system.

Having said that, the Naftali team encountered a few restrictions during
this investigation. The team didn't have direct access to client income
data for the first study question, so they had to create estimates about
a customer's income based on their postal code. While this generality
allows for adequate research, the team would require direct consumer
information to produce a more accurate report on market demographics.
With that stated, the Naftali team understands that income is sensitive
information, and that collecting it may trigger user privacy issues.
Furthermore, the data on median income utilized in this analysis was
collected in 2016. As a result, this figure may not accurately reflect
the customer's current earnings.

One limiting issue for the second research question is the availability
of missing values for the user's emoji modifier, indicating that they
utilized the default skin tone. As a result, the Naftali team is unable
to establish the race/ethnicity of those users, which adds to the
uncertainty and limits our ability to draw conclusions regarding the
association between device flags and user race. Similarly, the skin tone
of an emoji does not always correlate to the user's true racial
identity.

To address these constraints, MINGAR could send out an optional customer
survey in which customers can volunteer to contribute information such
as race. The use of this data, as well as any other potential ethical
considerations, must be disclosed by MINGAR. Customers must be able to
opt out of the survey if they so wish.

# Appendix

## Web scraping industry data on fitness tracker devices

The Fitness tracker info hub was used to scrape data on fitness tracker
devices. The Naftali team initially checked the website's scraping
permissions, noting that we are authorized to scrape with a minimum of
12 seconds between requests. We also gave details about our user agent
to clarify our intentions with the data we gathered. Only the
information that was strictly necessary was stored from the webpage. Our
goal was to avoid duplicating the dataset for this study and instead
focus on factors that were important to it.

## Accessing Census data on median household income

The Canadian census API was used to obtain data on median household
income. The Naftali team used CensusMapper to register an account,
followed the API's retrieval criteria, and cited CensusMapper in our
report. This is public data that is exposed to the public. The use of
this data complies with the Open Data Licence rules established by
Statistics Canada.

## Accessing postcode conversion files

Census Canada postal code conversion data was obtained through the
University of Toronto portal. Because the Naftali team is made up of
University of Toronto students, they had the necessary credentials to
access the information. The Naftali squad has consented to the license
agreement by downloading the dataset. In this report, the source for
this information has been credited.
